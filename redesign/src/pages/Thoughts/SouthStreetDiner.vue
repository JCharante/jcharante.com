        <p><b>Food at the South Street Diner</b></p>
        <p>I went there a couple weeks ago because I saw it was close to the only place open at 6am (I wanted to
        grab something to eat before heading in to volunteer at a robotics event). The only vegan offerings were
        a bottomless cup of [subpar] coffee, and some equally subpar potatoes. I'm glad that there's a place
        that is open 24/7 (and their prices reflect that), but if you're vegan just don't bother going there. Go eat some
        grass instead.</p>

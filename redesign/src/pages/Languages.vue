            <p>One of the things I like working on is learning languages. I'm not ambitious enough to have "learn <b>all</b>
            languages" on my bucket list, but I'd like to speak a decent amount.</p>
            <p>I was born in Peru and lived there until I moved to the US as a child. So I'm able to speak both English
              and Spanish at a native proficiency. Except, I'm pretty sure that if someone overhears me in Peru they'll
            see me as a foreigner and mug me two minutes later (I like my country but it's got a problem).</p>
            <p>I started learning Esperanto while secondary. Now that I live in Worcester, I'm able to attend "monthly"
              Boston Esperanto meetings.</p>
            <p>Both my roommates are a non-zero-percentage Vietnamese, and I have Vietnamese friends, so therefore the
              only logical step is to start learning Vietnamese.</p>
            <p>I want to take a foreign language to fulfill my humanities requirements. Spanish, German, Chinese are
              offered at WPI. It kinda feels like cheating to take Spanish, I'm not a fan of English so why would I
              take its parent, so the logical choice is to take Chinese. I'll probably end up minoring in it.
              Also, I have more Chinese friends than German friends, so I can torture them with boring small talk.
            </p>
            <p>I'd be pretty happy if I was able to speak the following languages by the time I finished college</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Spanish</li>
              <li>English</li>
              <li>Esperanto</li>
              <li>Vietnamese</li>
              <li>Mandarin</li>
            </ol>
            <p>At some point I'd like to learn Portuguese and Lojban.</p>

            <p>One of the things I like working on is learning languages.</p>
            <p>I was born in Peru and lived there until I moved to the US as a child. So I'm able to speak both English and Spanish at a native proficiency.</p>
            <p>However if someone overhears me in Peru they'll probably see me as a foreigner and mug me two minutes later.</p>
            <p>I started learning Esperanto while in high school. Now that I live in Massachusetts for college, I'm able to attend monthly Boston Esperanto meetings.</p>
            <p>Both my roommates are Vietnamese, and I have other Vietnamese friends, so therefore the only logical step is to start learning Vietnamese.</p>
            <p>I want to take a foreign language to fulfill my humanities requirements. Spanish, German, Chinese are offered at WPI.
              It kinda feels like cheating to take Spanish, I'm not a fan of English so why would I take its parent, so the logical choice
              is to take Chinese. I'll probably end up minoring in it. Also, I have more Chinese friends than German friends, so I can probably
              get them to help me at some point.
            </p>
            <p>I'd be pretty happy if I was able to speak the following languages by the time I finished college</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Spanish</li>
              <li>English</li>
              <li>Esperanto</li>
              <li>Vietnamese</li>
              <li>Mandarin</li>
            </ol>
            <p>At some point I'd like to learn Portuguese and Italian.</p>

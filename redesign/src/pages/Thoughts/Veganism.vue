        <p><b>Thoughts on "Veganism", PETA, and the IVA</b> (Fri Nov 23 '18)</p>
        <p>So this will probably be a work in progress for a while, but I'll keep adding to it unless I change my mind,
        in which case I'll create a new page to discuss my new thoughts on it and still keep this one around.</p>
        <p>So let me just talk a bit about, I don't want to be cheesy and call it a "journey" but I'm a cheesy person
        so I'm going to call it a journey. Hmm. actually now that I think about it, what if I'm not a cheesy <i>person</i>,
        but instead I consumed a bunch of cheesy media when I was learning English, so cheesy-ness is the only way I know how
        to express my sentiments in English.</p>
        <p><b>How I became vegetarian:</b> So my sister is a few years older than I am. She's always had an
        affinity for animals, and so she started volunteering at an animal shelter pretty frequently, and after a period
        of time, I want to say a year but it was probably 7 or 8 months, she convinced me to start volunteering
        there myself. Now at the time my favorite type of pizza was Hawaiian. I still remember walking an excerpt from
        when I was a small child, crossing a major junction enroute to a pizza place. We sat at a table that was located
        under a slight slope. Pineapple is absolutely delicious pizza topping. I don't remember when it began, but eventually
        it become a routine where my father would pick us up from the refuge league, and then we'd go out for pizza
        as a "reward".</p>
        <p>By the time this became routine, my sister had been volunteering for about a year, and had befriended
        the staff as well as other volunteers. She had realized that the staff was primarily composed of (at the very least)
        lacto-ovo vegetarians, which means they basically ate everything that a normal person eats except for meat. She
        learned that their reasoning was that they spend their time saving the lives of animals that in the Western
        world are considered pets. So why would they go home and eat meat, because meat is just the flesh of animals, and
        it's really hard to obtain flesh without killing the animal the flesh is taken from. So for them to spend their
        time trying to save the lives of certain species, and then go home and consume something that is obtained by killing
        other species, would be logical if and only if you don't believe in these two things:</p>
        <p><b>Respecting life</b>. I believe that I respect life. I don't go out of my way to cause harm to other
        creatures. I'm not saying that I live of a life free of cruelty. I'm not saying that eating plants is a cruelty-free
        diet, because insects are killer by pesticides. Critters are killer by machinery in the field. But either way
        crops are going to be harvested, and either fed to livestock or to humans. And there is cruelty in going on to
        raise the livestock and eat them. There is less cruelty in just eating the crops directly. Life becomes a series
        of choosing the lesser evil. I'm not saying that I am the ultimate example when it comes to respecting life. I don't
        live like a Jain saint but I <i>should</i> try to emulate them to a degree. I don't always inspect the ground
        that I walk on, or avoid walking on grass. I sometimes pluck leaves from trees and I walk at night when it's harder
        to avoid accidentally harming life. It is impossible to live a life free of cruelty, if you really want to do
        that then you can't even accomplish that by killing yourself, because you're killing the microbes and germs that
        reside within you. And it may seem extreme to try to avoid killing germs, and that's because it's just as
        extreme as living a life free of cruelty. They're both impractical, but like most things in life there's a
        middle ground. It being impossible to live a life free of cruelty doesn't mean we can't strive towards a life with <i>less cruelty</i>.</p>
        <p><b>Not treating others differently for immutable characteristics</b>. I try to be bipartisan as I go about my life. When I am aware of a bias that
        I have, I try to account for it. I'm going to go ahead and talk about a friend I met in high school. I haven't
        asked him if I can talk about him, so I'm going to say his name is Caleb in order to protect his identity. Now
        Caleb identified as a Dwarf because he met the definition of one. He had at least one condition that caused him
        to have bones that while not necessarily brittle, they were more prone to breaking compared to me and most
        other people. Sometimes he was able to walk around, while other times he was in a wheelchair or used a walker.
        Now when I first met him I saw that he was physically handicapped, and I recognized that I had a bias
        towards the physically handicapped, in the sense that I was nicer to them than to others. I was aware of it, and
        I didn't want to treat him any differently. Until I started reading the works of Aaron Swartz I didn't really have
        enough control over my emotions, so sometimes I would get mad or act like a dick towards Caleb, just like I would
        to anyone else. Sometimes I'd even be meaner to him to compensate for my inclination of being nice. Once I told
        him this he said that my behavior made a lot more sense now, and he shared a story about his kindergarten teacher.
        When Caleb was in kindergarten, his teacher was so fucking mean to him, because she didn't want the other
        kids to see that she treated him differently. He was to be treated just like everyone else. Except she went
        way too fucking overboard.</p>
        <p>So this goes beyond how you treat individuals. I think that if more people held this belief then we wouldn't
        have problems with racism, sexism, or classism. Because, I might be understating this, but it is fucking hard to
        change your ethnicity. It's hard to change whether you were born as a man or woman. It's hard to change the family you
        were born into, or their income level when you were 4 years old. You can't change who you're attracted to in a major way.
        Those things are downright immutable. Those are traits that you can't change.
        You can't change being born with a cleft lip. You're a fucking dick if you treat people differently
        for an immutable characteristic. They can't fucking change it, so how is criticizing someone for an
        immutable characteristic anything other than stroking your fucked up ego. If everyone had this belief then there
        wouldn't have been problems like multi-generational slavery, because when the slaves had children the owners would have
        been like "well, it's not your fucking fault you were born to slaves". And I think people have this belief to a
        degree, that's why we have the public education system, because no matter what your immutable characteristics are,
        you should be able to get an education just like everyone else. Growing up in Peru, everyone was so fucking racist,
        and now growing up in America it's like a nice little bubble by comparison. </p>

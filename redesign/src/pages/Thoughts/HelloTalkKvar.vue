        <p><b>Hello Talk</b>: Fourth Update (Mon Nov 26 '18)</p>
        <p>Okay cool I've actually started speaking to some Esperantistoj.</p>
        <p>Okay I'm also getting the left-handed English speaking teen girls aged 12 to 17 for a Typing User Study ad
        on facebook. I guess everyone in Worcester is getting these. I wonder if I should bring up the subject with someone.
        Either they'll think I'm a creep or they'll be like holy shit you too??</p>
        <p>As the sun came and went in Vietnam, I started receiving a decent amount of messages, to the point where
        I'd have to cut conversations short to get back to work. I had seen a review about Hello Talk from a <q-chip>English >>
        Russian</q-chip> user who complained that he was getting bombarded by messages from <q-chip>Russian >> English</q-chip> users
        to the point that he uninstalled the app, presumably because the were more <q-chip>Russian >> English</q-chip>
        users than <q-chip>English >> Russian</q-chip>, and I'm glad that the ratio is somewhat advantagous for me. I think that's
        interesting is just how nice everyone is. Whenever you correct someone's moment they'll reply to you thanking you. It's
        happened every single time.</p>

        <p><b>Texas: too fucking hot</b> (Nov '18)</p>
        <p>I was in San Antonio during my school's October break, and on my final "full" day there, I felt like I was dying.</p>
        <p>You know how indoor pools in hotels are generally very humid? It felt like I was in a full suit and tie at an indoor
        pool whenever I stepped foot outside. I looked into it and it looks like that day wasn't that bad in particular,
        but goddamn I could never acclimate to that. I still look back at my first weeks at WPI, for the first time
        in the US living somewhere without air conditioning.. that was brutal.</p>
        <p>I said I could never acclimate to Texas weather. I wonder if during the summer I'll be wishing I was in Texas instead.</p>

        <p><b>Hello Talk</b>: Third Update (Sun Nov 25 '18)</p>
        <p>So something that's bothering me, and it's not specific to Hello Talk, Drops "suffers" from it too, is that
        when I'm trying to get stuff done on my desktop I have to look down at my phone, and I wish I could just open/access
        the apps online. I'd a pain to pick up my phone and type stuff instead of writing it from my keyboard. Although
        I should be somewhat thankful since I have autocomplete, although I don't know if that's a crutch or not.</p>
        <p>Anyways, as it gets later in the day, and more and more people from Vietnam awake, I'm getting more activity
        on Hello Talk, which is great! Except I have to get a bunch of stuff done and I don't have the self control
        to not respond. To be fair it's on schoolwork that I'm working on, if I was doing paid stuff obviously I would
        control myself.</p>

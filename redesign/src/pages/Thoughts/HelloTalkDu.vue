        <p><b>Hello Talk</b>: Second Update (Sun Nov 25 '18)</p>
        <p>I'm not sure if it's okay to call this the second update, since I don't think you can call the first post an
        update.. but I'm sticking with it because I've already named this file HelloTalkDu.vue and I don't want
        to rename it to HelloTalkUnu.vue, because I'd presume that HelloTalk.vue already means HelloTalkUnu.vue</p>
        <p>So I got my first reply. I originally sent out messages at 1pm, which was around 1am in Vietnam, but
        minutes ago I started having my first conversation with someone. It was going really well, but unfortunately
        I had to cut it short because I have a million deadlines crashing down on me.</p>
        <p>I must say, having a roommate* who natively speaks your target language is invaluable, because
        when I told my pal that I had to study, she replied with "Cố lên!" and the built-in translation tool said
        it meant "Fighting!", but that makes no sense in the context. My roommate says that it means something along
        the lines of "go forth with a fighting spirit! obliterate it! kill it!" which makes more sense. So I'm
        very grateful for those vibes.</p>
        <p>*I actually have two roommates who speak Vietnamese.</p>
